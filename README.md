## Welcome to our 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google!
### What is the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive?
This 5-day online course was crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers to help developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents. You’ll learn the core components – models, tools, orchestration, memory and evaluation. Finally, you’ll discover how agents move beyond LLM prototypes to become production-ready systems.

Each day blends conceptual deep dives with hands-on examples, codelabs, and live discussions. By the end, you’ll be ready to build, evaluate, and deploy agents that solve real-world problems.

This page serves as the central hub for all course materials, updates and resources.

### How the Course Works:

The course is designed to be flexible and interactive, allowing you to learn at your own pace while benefiting from live sessions and community engagement.
**Daily Content Release:** New assignments will be posted each day on this Kaggle course page - your primary source for all course materials.
Assignment Notifications (Fast Follow): Given the large number of participants, links to all assignment materials including whitepapers, codelabs and podcast episodes — will also be shared on the Kaggle Discord and sent via follow-up email shortly after being posted.
**Support & Discussion:** Join the discussion on our dedicated Discord channels to connect with other learners, ask questions, and get support from Google researchers and engineers who will be monitoring the channels throughout the week.
Daily Livestreams: Join Kanchana Patlolla and Anant Nawalgaria live each day starting Monday, November 10th at 11 AM PT / 8 PM CET / 12:30 AM IST on **Kaggle’s YouTube channel.** They will be joined by special guests from Google, NVIDIA, Cohere and more. After each session, recordings will be shared on Discord.
**Course Completion:** To get the most out of this intensive, we recommend completing all course materials including whitepapers, podcasts and codelabs before starting the capstone project. Assignments are provided for your learning, so assignment submissions are not required and you can complete them at your own pace.
**Capstone Project:** On the final day, you’ll have the chance to apply everything you’ve learned by building your own AI agent. By participating in the capstone project, you will earn a badge on Kaggle.
**Community:** We want this community to be positive and supportive. Please follow Kaggle’s community guidelines found here.
